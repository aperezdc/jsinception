# JS: Inception Talk

This is the source for the slides I have used for the [JS:Inception
talk](http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/#/speakers/adrian-perez-de-castro-javascript-in-javascript-inception)
at [JSConf EU 2014](http://2014.jsconf.eu).

## Building

You will need a [Hovercraft](https://github.com/regebro/hovercraft),
a C preprocessor installed as ``cpp`` (and which accepts the command
line arguments ``-P``, ``-w`` and ``-nostdinc``), and Make. Yes: Make.

Build with:

```sh
make
```
